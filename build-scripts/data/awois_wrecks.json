Although no contacts were\nlocated within the radius, the Hydrographer notes that the position data in the AWOIS record is very\ninconsistent. The original reported position is located on shore at the southern tip of James Island. The\nrevised position in the AWOIS record is located 3,850m SW of the original position. Also, the closest\ncharted wreck PA is located 450 m south of the revised position. The hydrographer is assuming that\nthis is the corresponding charted feature, as a separate AWOIS number is not listed for it. The contact\nreferenced in this report appears to be a cabin cruiser, approximately 33 ft long, located 1,550 m WSW of\nthe revised position in the AWOIS record. Knowing that a small, submerged boat has the potential to\ndrift a significant distance due to currents in the area, the hydrographer believes this wreck to be the one\nreferenced in AWOIS 11,935. The hydrographer recommends ADDING a 53 Wk w/ danger curve at 38° 27' 43.75\" N, 076° 21' 54.32\" W, and retaining the wreck PA as charted. (PTT 9/29/06)."},

The feature is located within the 2000-meter search radius of and closely matches the length and width dimensions of AWOIS 1813; however, the hydrographer is unable to definatively substantiate that the current feature is the wreck of AWOIS 1813 because no diver investigation was performed and another wreck (of the five located within or very near the search radius of AWOIS 1813) also closely matches the dimensions of AWOIS 1813.

The wreck was located with 100% MBES (EM 1002) and developed with 100% SSS (KLEIN 5500) and 100% MBES (RESON 8101). The wreck is 32.5 meters long and 5 meters wide. The feature is located within the 200-meter search radius for AWOIS 2730 (a charted 123-foot reported non-dangerous wreck) and the 2000-meter search raduis for AWOIS 1813 (a charted wreck believed to be the tug \"Barataria\"). The history for AWOIS 2730 indicates that a past hydrographer believed that AWOIS 2730 may have been the wreck represented by AWOIS 1813; however, the current hydrographer is unable to definitively substantiate this claim since (1) no diver investigation was done and (2) the current feature does not correspond to the description of the Barataria included in the proprietary section of AWOIS 1813 (which describes a wreck 20.9 by 5.5 meters). NOTE: From the AWOIS descriptions, it appears the past hydrographer based his claim on knowing about only two wrecks. The current survey data show a total of five wrecks within or very near the search radii of AWOIS 1813, two of which (addressed in other feature reports) do indeed correspond to the AWOIS description (RES 11/30/07).\n\n\n\n DESCRIPTION\n  206  LORAN C RATES: 9960-W 14863.9; 9960-Y 43965.9.
